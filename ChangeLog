WAF-FLE ChangeLog


Version 0.6.4: Jul, 25 2014
-------------
Fixed Bugs:
- Issue #39 (google code) fixed to allow character [ and ] in the msg 
  event log. While not usual, can happen. Other fields were also 
  affected.
- Lack of output encoding in some filter fields (filter dialog and 
  current filter), when a bogus hostname present in event, cause 
  improper html rendering. Thanks to Marcus Semblano to report and 
  supply with path;
- In some circunstances the filter dialog are unable to show web 
  hostnames (ie. when more that 2000 entries), this is a 
  limitation/protection of browsers. Now the hostname was changed from a 
  combo-box, to a text input with autocomplete powered by a Ajax
  interface, that brings hostnames when you type it on hostname field. 
  This fixes issue #15 on github. Thanks to Juraj Sakala for report and
  discuss it;
- Issue #7 (github) were "PCRE limits exceeded" start to be handled 
  properly with attribution of a virtual rule id configurable in 
  config.php (default in 99999), with patch of Juraj Sakala;
- Session is now enforced correctly when an AJAX operation is called.
- Custom Tags ID's changed to start in 1000, to avoid conflict with 
  native tags (thanks to Juraj Sakala);
- Typo corrected in mlog2waffle.conf (thanks to Juraj Sakala);
- Typo corrected in event feeder wizard;
- Text revised in event feeder wizard;
- Better URL handling in request, patch from Juraj Sakala;
- Typo correction in functions.php, patch from Juraj Sakala;
- Bad dashboard page formating (Issue #37), patch from Juraj Sakala;
- This change addresses the issue #43 (at Google Code), it reflects 
  problem with the modsec index file line parsing, that has an empty or 
  malformed Host header. Patch from Juraj Sakala;
- Fixed issue #43, when processing filter with "not tag" generate an 
  error.
- Issue #45, unescaped output on TopRules chart, make chart unusable 
  when a special character is in rule description. Thanks to Ibere Tizio, 
  by report and propose a fix.
- Issue #47, typo in redirect definition on waf-fle.conf (apache config 
  file) for WAF-FLE;
- Issue #47, error in IP address validation function of Add Sensor in 
  management interface;
- Fixes github issue #13, processing of client ip range defined by a 
  netmask;
- Issue #18, fixes regression on client IP filter with no netmask, 
  thanks to Juraj Sakala for the patch;
- Added parsing and filter to events with "pause" action;
- Change the management menu behavior, to address a performance impact 
  described by Juraj Sakala (in issue #14 on GitHub). A temporary denial 
  of service happens while database events are counted for get sensor 
  information. Now the user can change (on config.php and in runtime) if 
  Sensor Info will be loaded or not. Database schema change to fix this, 
  but will change in update process only on next release, if you want to 
  change now, access your MySQL and use the command below (this can need 
  some time and disk space):      
     # use waffle;
     # ALTER TABLE `waffle`.`events` ADD INDEX `sensor3` (`sensor_id`);

Improvements:
- mlog2waffle requirements better clarified in their README, and now is 
  possible to use it with old version of libwww-perl, but no self-signed 
  certificate in that case;
- Better error message in case of database error;
- mlog2waffle now has a crontab script;
- You can disable/enable error log in mlog2waffle in mlog2waffle.conf;
- waf-fle.conf minor text adjustment;
- Corrected push-mlogc.sh template in Event Feeder Wizard;
- Filter for preserved events added. Thanks to Juraj Sakala;
- Better event handling in controller, code cleanup, including broken 
  log format of libinjetion, thanks to Juraj Sakala for propose code and 
  show the libinject problem in issue #17;
- Event details are reordered to put "Rule Message" first, event details 
  after;
- Some grammar correction. Thanks to Cliton Nichols;
- Now accept events sent by mod_security compiled/patched by Atomic 
  Turtle to change label "Producer" to "WAF". Issue #22 and #48;
- mlog2waffle now support event index created by mod_security 
  compiled/patched by Atomic Turtle;
- Better session handling: The session are regenerated when a sucessful 
  login occour, and after 10 times the SESSION_TIMEOUT, make session 
  more robust against session hijack/fixation.
- Session expiration are now better handled, timeout happen between the
  finish of a page processing and the next access;
- Event list is better sorted now, first by event_id, later by timestamp
- Better error message when the user are trying to setup WAF-FLE and 
  have not defined the $SETUP variable in config.php.
- Improved APCu support, as PHP version 5.5 now need to use APCu instead
  of deprecated APC, some adjust in code was done with better 
  information in management/info about which module is load.
